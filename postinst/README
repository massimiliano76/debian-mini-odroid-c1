Place your custom post installation scripts here and mark them executable.
They will be executed in the emulated target by postinstall.sh
You can also place scripts in a subdirectory with the same name as the DIST
variable as defined in common.mk, allowing you to specify scripts custom to
a specific distribution.  The scripts in a distribution subdirectory will
be executed after the common ones.
